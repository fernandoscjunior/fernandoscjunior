# Hello, It's me Fernando Jr :D

  I'm Fernando Costa Jr currently studying at **BYU-I** to become a software developer.
I started learning software development in 2018 with Python, since then I specialized in Front-End development and the foundations of software development.

**Skills (Work in progress)** <br>
-Programming Languages : Python | Javascript | C# <br>
-Frameworks : Express.js <br>
-General tools : HTML | CSS | git | SQL <br>
-Stuff I know and maybe will forget that I know : Vite.js | (MySQL, Workbench, Postgres, pgAdmin) | VS Code <br>

**Projects (In progress too)**
Simple Front-End only web pages

**My future**
I haven't chosen a specific role yet... <br>
It is just there is so much to learn and everything seems so interesting (except web dev lol)
