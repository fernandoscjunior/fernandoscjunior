# Hello, It's me Fernando Jr :D

  I'm Fernando Costa Jr currently studying at *BYU-I* to become a software developer.
I started learning software development in 2018 with *Python*, since then I specialized in Front-End development and the foundations of software development 
*(like git, SQL etc)*.

**Skills (Work in progress)**
Programming Languages : Python | Javascript | C#
Frameworks : Express.js
General tools : HTML | CSS | git | SQL
Stuff I know and maybe will forget that I know : Vite.js | (MySQL, Workbench, Postgres, pgAdmin) | VS Code

**Projects (In progress too)**
Simple Front-End only web pages

**My future**
I haven't chosen a specific role yet...
It is just there is so much to learn and everything seems so interesting (except web dev lol)
